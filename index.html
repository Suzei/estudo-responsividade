                    Kazuma Kiryu (桐生 一馬, Kiryū Kazuma) is the most recurring protagonist of the Yakuza series. He is featured as the main protagonist and playable character in Yakuza/Yakuza Kiwami, Yakuza 2/Yakuza Kiwami 2, Yakuza 3 and Yakuza 6. He is featured as one of multiple main protagonists and playable characters in Yakuza 0, Yakuza 4 and Yakuza 5.

                    His legendary accomplishments and ascent through the ranks of the Tojo Clan's Dojima Family, as well as the tattoo of a dragon on his back, have earned him the nickname "The Dragon of Dojima" (堂島の龍, Dōjima no Ryū). He was the fourth chairman of the Tojo Clan, and previously managed Morning Glory Orphanage.
                    <br><br>
                    Kiryu is the honor-bound dreamer of the dark Yakuza world. He is not the type to judge others and is generally accepting of anyone who is friendly towards him. He lives by a strict code of honor and holds a very strong sense of justice. While he is extremely kind and goes out of his way to help civilians, he considers himself a Yakuza at heart, commonly using violence above words, so long as it is justified.
                    <br><br>
                    He generally lets his actions and mannerisms speak for him when possible. He tends to be the listening ear to the world, giving advice in response to his environment rather than seeking out conversations. He is wise but certainly not all-knowing, and generally means well for those around him, which makes him surprisingly pragmatic and well-liked.

                <p class="majima format-text">
                    Goro Majima (真島 吾朗, Majima Gorō) is a recurring supporting character in the Yakuza series. He appears as a supporting character and boss character in each of Yakuza/Yakuza Kiwami, Yakuza 2/Yakuza Kiwami 2, Yakuza 3, Yakuza 4 and Yakuza 5. He is featured as one of multiple playable protagonists in Yakuza 0 and Yakuza: Dead Souls, and is also the main protagonist and playable character of Yakuza Kiwami 2's Majima Saga.
                    <br><br>
                    Majima is a resourceful, charismatic, and commanding individual. He has gained the respect of friend and foe alike, often with his ferocious abilities in battle. Despite being the patriarch of his own family - and later, lieutenant advisor to the sixth chairman, Daigo Dojima - he dislikes serious meetings and often finds a way to showily barge his way into them. He is shown to have a soft spot for his family members - even if he is prone to physically punishing them for their disobedience.
                    <br><br>
                    He has a fierce, somewhat twisted sense of loyalty, especially when it comes to his rival-turned-friend, Kazuma Kiryu. Majima believes he is the only one entitled to kill Kiryu, and has nearly died trying to protect that right. In later games, it appears to become somewhat of a running joke between the two rather than a true threat. He respects physical power above all else, and often pesters Kiryu into fighting him to prove himself whenever a favor is asked of him.

                Taiga Saejima (冴島 大河, Saejima Taiga) is a recurring protagonist and character in the series. He appears as one of multiple main protagonists and playable characters in both Yakuza 4 and Yakuza 5. He appears in flashbacks in Yakuza 0 and is a supporting character in Yakuza 6. He is a former member of the Sasai Family of the Tojo Clan, and later became the patriarch of the Saejima family. He is the sworn brother of Goro Majima.
                <br><br>
                Saejima is exceedingly blunt, and is never one to beat around the bush in a conversation. This can lead to him sounding harsh or pessimistic, but his words are usually meant with the best of intentions.
                <br><br>
Saejima's selflessness surfaces often in the series, especially apparent in his willingness to return to jail prior to the events of Yakuza 5 and Yakuza 6 in order to clear his name for the good of the Tojo Clan, as well as in his speech after the fight in Purgatory's coliseum, refusing to kill his opponent even with the promise of information from The Florist. During his youth, he gave up his dream of becoming an elementary school teacher in order to take care of his step-sister, Yasuko, even though he was just 15 at the time.
